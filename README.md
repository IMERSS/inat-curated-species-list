# inat-curated-species-list

A tool to query iNaturalist for all observations made by one or more users in a specific taxon and place, and derive a curated list of all unique species, along with the option to download it. This allows you to create tailored list of species that have been approved by a group of experts, rather than rely on the community "research grade" standard.

### Demo

You can [access the script here](https://imerss.github.io/inat-curated-species-list/), but if you're a dev, please download it and run it locally.

## Run locally

The script requires npm and node. Run:

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`
